The csv file for cohort in the raw-data folder includes 5,000 observations with variables smoke, female, age, cardiac, and cost. Based on our analysis of the cohort data in the "Assignment 4" Quarto file, we run a linear regression of cost on age, smoke, female, and cardiac. We find statistical significannce for all coefficients of the covariates. The main results are below:

Controlling for other covariates, age has a significant incremental effect on cost at ~$16 per year. Fixing all other variables (non-smokers, no cardiac event, average age), females have lower costs than males by $253 per visit. Adjusting for age, smoking status, and gender (baseline is non-smoking men), those having a cardiac event costs $408 on average more than those note having a cardiac event (as the graph in our analysis / pdf shows). Finally, smoking has the largest individual effect on cost of visit ($542 on average more than non-smokers), controlling for all other variables.
